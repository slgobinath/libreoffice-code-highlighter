Code snippet highlighter for LibreOffice Writer and Impress.


## Archived
This project is archived and no longer. There is an active fork of this project available
at https://github.com/jmzambon/libreoffice-code-highlighter 
I highly recommend any existing or future users to switch to this forked version as I do not
have time anymore to maintain this project.

Unfortunately my old LibreOffice Extensions account credentials do not work anymore (or I have
the wrong one). If anyone has contacts in LibreOffice, please bring down the original extension
from https://extensions.libreoffice.org/en/extensions/show/code-highlighter

After installation, set the environment variable: `PYTHONPATH` pointing to: `C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python<PythonVersion>\Lib\site-packages`.
